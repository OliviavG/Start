						<h2> Why him? </h2>
							<p> His entire life was devoted to learning & creating </p>
							<ul> 
								<li> He was a scholar </li>
								<li> He was a artist </li>
								<li> He was an inventor </li>
								<li> He loved maps too </li>
							</ul>
							<p> And perhaps the best reason is that he combined all his knowledge in all his creations. Example being mixing his knowlegde of physics and how best to portray a humanbeing in a portret by applying the laws of the golden ratio. Additionally he added hidden messages in his paintings about the figures displayed or other more political topics often in a religious view </p>

						<h2> Φ = 1.618 </h2>
							<p> Phi ( Φ = 1.618033988749895… ), most often pronounced fi like “fly,” is simply an irrational number like pi ( p = 3.14159265358979… ), but one with many unusual mathematical properties.  Unlike pi, which is a transcendental number, phi is the solution to a quadratic equation.</p>
