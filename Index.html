				<h2> Why do we do this?</h2>
					<p class="summary"> Because we love food, but have varying needs for how much time we want to spend in the kitchen we would love to have a little reminder of what our favorite recipes are stored in a place where everyone from our friends can easily access this super valuable information. We sail under the rule that everyone is welcome in our kitchen so our recipes are also available for everyone. Feel free to share and enjoy cooking </p>

				<h2> Foodstagramming </h2> 
				<p> I only need to glance at my own Instagram page to see that I’m guilty of it. Scrolling through my images, aside from an obvious obsession with the Valencia filter, one thing really stands out. Like most people these days, snapshots of food feature heavily in my photo feed. 

				Look a little more carefully though and another thing is glaringly obvious: the food featured in said posts ranges rather drastically from angelically clean and green, to sinfully sugar-laden. Every gloriously righteous ‘health-spo’ photo is followed by a line-up of lychee martinis or a giant ‘cheat day’ bowl of tiramisu. I have become a tale of two extremes.

				Social media is a great tool for flagging up certain behavioural patterns – where else do we document our daily lives for all to see and scrutinise? So it’s no surprise that looking through other people’s Twitter feeds and Instagram pages, I see plenty of fellow sufferers who follow two wildly opposing eating patterns, on a regular basis, and are keen to let everyone know about it.</p>
