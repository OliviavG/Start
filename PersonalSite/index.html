				<h2> Why have I made this site?</h2>
					<p class="summary"> To be perfectly honest, I am currently learning all about front-end development and my current assignment is to create a website that will go live. That is when I figured 'why not make a site where I can collect all the nice recipes of my and my friends?'. It is of course also very convenient that this is perfectly oke info to share (I had to do some thinking about what I could share in terms of content with the entire digital world out there) :) and me and my friends just love food and talking about food. Therefore, I would like to invite all of you to share your favorite recipes and restaurants with me! </p>

				<h2> Foodstagramming </h2> 
				<p> I only need to glance at my own Instagram page to see that I’m guilty of it. Scrolling through my images, aside from an obvious obsession with the Valencia filter, one thing really stands out. Like most people these days, snapshots of food feature heavily in my photo feed. 

				Look a little more carefully though and another thing is glaringly obvious: the food featured in said posts ranges rather drastically from angelically clean and green, to sinfully sugar-laden. Every gloriously righteous ‘health-spo’ photo is followed by a line-up of lychee martinis or a giant ‘cheat day’ bowl of tiramisu. I have become a tale of two extremes.

				Social media is a great tool for flagging up certain behavioural patterns – where else do we document our daily lives for all to see and scrutinise? So it’s no surprise that looking through other people’s Twitter feeds and Instagram pages, I see plenty of fellow sufferers who follow two wildly opposing eating patterns, on a regular basis, and are keen to let everyone know about it.</p>
