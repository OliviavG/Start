			<h2> About Bee </h2>
				<p> Bee, my awesome roommate, is someone I would describe as extremely efficient. With food she runs by the formula max pleasure equals max taste for min effort. I don't think I know anyone that is better at figuring out ways to minimize effort in the kitchen if it is not needed. That doesn't mean that she will not cook up recipes that require effort, but she will only do that to spoil her friends if the occasion is right. Anyways, enough said. Find out what recipes & delivery tips classify her. </p>

				<h2> How to make it? </h2> 

				<p> First thing that you need to do is fire up your oven on 180 degrees. Next go to the store to buy the following ingredients: </p>
				<p> </p>

				<ol type="I">
					<li> 6 Lamb Sausages (merkez) </li>
					<li> 3 pieces of Zucchini or Eggplant (depending on what you like most) </li>
					<li> +/- 12 small tasty tomatoes (Tasty Toms)</li>
					<li> 1 Big piece of Garlic with enough 4 cloves per person (can be more if you really like it) </li>
					<li> Fresh Rozemary Twigs </li>
					<li> 1 Cup of Olive oil (use calculator at the bottom of the page to calculate) </li>
					<li> Pepper & Salt </li>
				</ol>

				<p> Next up, while your oven is preheating, cut your zucchinis and eggplant in to 4 pieces, by slicing them from top t bottom so you get nice and long pieces of veggies. Get your garlic and select 12 cloves and leave the skin on the cloves. Put all the ingredients together in 1 big aluminium oven dish and try to make sure that the veggies lie on the bottom and the sausages on top if you like crispy sausages. Divide the twigs of rozemary through the dish, some on the bottom to spread the flavour in the juice and some on top for garnish for your meal later. Sprinkle some olive oil through the dish to make sure your veggies and sausages don't burn or stick and sprinkle some pepper and salt over the food. Especially the eggplant can use some salt. </p>

				<p> After you are done, put the entire dish into the oven (which should be now be 180 degrees) and grab yourself a glass of nice red wine while you wait for 45 minutes till your meal is ready </p>
